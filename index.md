This site will help you visualize a computer's architecture in a clearer way than just reading a book. Every single piece of knowledge present in this site comes from [Miles J. Murdocca's "Principles of Computer Architecture"](http://academicos.azc.uam.mx/oan/lac/Murdocca_en.pdf).

The chapters covered are:

* Chapter 4: Machine Language and Assembly Language
    
    This chapter....
    
    This is the first level of abstraction, so it is recommended to start here

* Chapter 6: Datapath and Control

    
* Also, content from the sections 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 was taken to give a brief introduction to the site's main content.
