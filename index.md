This site will help you visualize a computer's architecture in a clearer way than just reading a book. Every single piece of knowledge present in this site comes from [Miles J. Murdocca's "Principles of Computer Architecture"](http://academicos.azc.uam.mx/oan/lac/Murdocca_en.pdf).

The chapters covered are:

* Chapter 4: Machine Language and Assembly Language
    
    This chapter....
    
    This is the first level of abstraction, so it is recommended to start here

* Chapter 5: Languages and The Machine

* Chapter 6: Datapath and Control
