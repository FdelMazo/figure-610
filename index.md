This site will help you visualize a computer's architecture in a clearer way than just reading a book. Every single piece of knowledge present in this site comes from [Miles J. Murdocca's "Principles of Computer Architecture"](http://academicos.azc.uam.mx/oan/lac/Murdocca_en.pdf).

The title of this site comes from the figure in page 210, which shows in great detail the microarchitecture of the computer. The goal of this site is to have this figure understood __in it's entirety__ by the end of reading everything.

The chapters covered are:

* Chapter 4: Machine Language and Assembly Language
    
    This chapter....
    
    This is the first level of abstraction, so it is recommended to start here

* Chapter 5: Languages and The Machine

* Chapter 6: Datapath and Control
