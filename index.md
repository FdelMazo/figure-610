This site will help you visualize a computer's architecture in a clearer way than just reading a book. Every single piece of knowledge present in this site comes from [Miles J. Murdocca's "Principles of Computer Architecture"](http://academicos.azc.uam.mx/oan/lac/Murdocca_en.pdf).

This site was designed as a study tool for desktop users (as it heavily relies on mouse events).

If you come from mobile, you will be disappointed.
